## Inspiration

Nowadays the internet is used for everything since is an affordable way to get information. This is why we decided to build Skinre, millions of people around the world faced skin problems (acne) and don't know how to resolve them. Like statics say people rather have a phone or computer in their hands rather than food or money itself.  So why don't create affordable acne learning, interactive and organizing system for users to understand what their skin is facing and how to deal with it on a daily basis.

## What it does

Skinre is based on 3 main features:

**1. Chrome Extension**-  the chrome extension is used for the user to organized the skin routine. We have a daily quiz that the output will be a certain color (green, yellow, or red) based on what the user fills a calendar included in the extension will have each day on the color the quiz gave out. Finally, we have a status page where the user sets out his skin routine for as long as he needs it.

**2. Acne AI Cam-** the AI cam detects the type of acne the user has developed This will help the user figure out which products he can use to treat his skin by going to our product page where we sorted all the products for each type of acne our AI cam detects.

## How we built it

Due to wanting to create an extension and website we needed to build something separate:

**1. the extension-** the extension was built using React. It simply shows several tabs, each of which reads data from Chrome's synced storage API and displays it. We used webpack and SCSS to create it.
**2. the website-** the website was built with react mainly also has some javascript for the backend.

## Challenges we ran into

Our plans change a little when we initiated the website in React instead of HTML. At first, we were planning to do the website in HTML and the extension on React but we ended up doing it all in React This cause a few problems since repl.it is not the best editor to work with, some of us were even considering moving back to HTML only 10 hours away from the hackathon but thanks to our persistent team members we stayed in with React and made it work!

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Is the first time we integrate a chrome extension into a hackathon project and for that, we are extremely proud of the determination of two of our team members who worked on the front and backend of the extension. Another accomplishment we're proud of is the classic accomplishment of finishing everything just in time. Due to our time zones is was hard because for some team members it was night time meanwhile for others it was daytime.  All-nighters were almost done heh.
